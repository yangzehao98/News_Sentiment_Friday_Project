        "content": "Coca-Cola Consolidated's COKE short percent of float has risen 4.79% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 102 thousand shares sold short, which is 1.75% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.21 days to cover their short positions on average. Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish. See Also: List of the most shorted stocks As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Coca-Cola Consolidated has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted. Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro, Coca-Cola Consolidated's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 7.57%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

        "content": "Wednesday marks the last chance for investors to receive the next  dividend payout from Coca-Cola Consolidated COKE.  The company announced on Tuesday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. On Thursday, Coca-Cola Consolidated will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open 50 cents lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date\u2014in this case, Thursday. Shareholders who own COKE as of the end of Wednesday's session are eligible to receive the 50 cents dividend payout for every share that they own.  According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on February 09, 2024. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.  Track real-time stock fluctuations for Coca-Cola Consolidated on Benzinga.",

The company announced on Friday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. On Thursday, Coca-Cola Consolidated will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open 50 cents lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date\u2014in this case, Thursday. Shareholders who own COKE as of the end of Wednesday's session are eligible to receive the 50 cents dividend payout for every share that they own.  According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on November 10, 2023. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.

        "content": "Wednesday marks the last chance for investors to receive the next  dividend payout from Coca-Cola Consolidated COKE.  The company announced on Friday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. On Thursday, Coca-Cola Consolidated will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open 50 cents lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date\u2014in this case, Thursday. Shareholders who own COKE as of the end of Wednesday's session are eligible to receive the 50 cents dividend payout for every share that they own.  According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on August 11, 2023. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.

        "content": "Shares of Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc. COKE rose by 9.27% in the past three months. When understanding a companies price change over a time period like 3 months, it could be helpful to look at its financials. One key aspect of a companies financials is its debt, but before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Coca-Cola Consolidated has.  Based on Coca-Cola Consolidated's balance sheet as of February 22, 2023, long-term debt is at $606.34 million and current debt is at $4.98 million, amounting to $611.32 million in total debt. Adjusted for $197.65 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $413.67 million. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.  To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Coca-Cola Consolidated's $3.71 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.16. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, but average for another. Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

        "content": "FaZe Holdings Inc FAZE, the professional esports and entertainment organization with headquarters in Los Angeles, California, USA, has seen its worth drop significantly since going public last year. The organization was founded in 2010 as a gaming clan for Activision ATVI\u2019s \"Call of Duty,\" and has since expanded into a lifestyle brand, representing some of the biggest names in gaming, music, sports, and entertainment, such as Coca-Cola COKE, Microsoft MSFT, Sony SONY's Play Station, and McDonald's MCD. See also:\u00a0From YouTube To Nasdaq: How FaZe Clan Transformed An eSports Channel Into A Multi-Million-Dollar Business Backed By Pitbull, Offset And Others However, despite claiming to be worth $700 million when it went public on July 20, 2022, by way of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), FaZe is now in penny stock territory, trading as low as $0.97 per share on February 6. But, what happened? Factors such as controversy surrounding some members and a possible burst in the esports bubble may be contributing to the lack of investment in the company. According to Kotaku, the stock price of FaZe Clan's FaZe Holdings fell below $1 for the first time ever on January 20 and continued to decrease throughout the following days. If this trend continues for over a month, the company risks getting delisted from the Nasdaq. On this subject, Lee Trink, FaZe\u2019s CEO, told Forbes: \u201cAs we described in our Q3 announcement, FaZe is seeing strong business momentum with brands, talent and the gaming community following our entry to the public markets, and our revenue performance and full-year expectations reflect that.\u201d See also:\u00a0Could The Hype Around eSports Be Fading? Find Out Why Some Experts Think So Trink continued: \u201cGiven the broader economy as well as lower-than-expected proceeds from the go-public transaction, we are moving aggressively to manage our capital while looking at ways to enhance our balance sheet to pursue the growth opportunities in front of us.\u201d Furthermore, as of September 30th, 2022, FaZe reported a cash balance of $43.9 million, which is sufficient to support its ongoing operations only until November 2023. The company expressed concerns in its quarterly regulatory filing, stating, \"The current circumstances have created significant doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern, which depends on our capacity to generate substantial revenue and secure additional funds through debt and equity financing.\" It's worth noting that the organization has players from around the world, across multiple games, including Valve's \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,\" Krafton's \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" Ubisoft UBSFF's \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,\" Xbox's \"Halo Infinite,\" Tencent TCEHY's \"Valorant,\" and \"Fortnite Battle Royale,\" Psyonix's \"Rocket League,\" and Nintendo NTDOY's \"Super Smash Bros.

The company announced on Wednesday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share. On Thursday, Coca-Cola Consolidated will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open 50 cents lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date\u2014in this case, Thursday. Shareholders who own COKE as of the end of Wednesday's session are eligible to receive the 50 cents dividend payout for every share that they own.  According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on February 10, 2023. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.

        "content": "The Christopher Columbus High School in South Florida introduced a groundbreaking program for students who are not interested in physical sports: they can now play electronic sports, also known as esports. Esports are a form of competition using video games, such as Tencent TCEHY\u2019s \"Valorant\" and \"LoL;\" Epic Games\u2019 \"Fortnite;\" Valve\u2019s \u201cDota 2,\u201d and \"Counter-Strike;\" EA EA\u2019s \u201cApex Legends;\u201d and Activision-Blizzard ATVI\u2019s \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d and \"Overwatch.\" Curious as it may seem, this new project originated in the educational institution will surely excite and motivate many students, as well as provide them with new opportunities. With this new program, students now have the possibility to access scholarships at the college level, while experiencing a team environment and competing with other schools. See also:\u00a0Esports Power Rankings: The Most Watched Teams In The Last Year  In dialogue with WSVN, Alex Seage, a faculty member at Christopher Columbus High Scool, said: \u201cWe\u2019re always elevating the bar we allow the kids to explore ways of doing things that interest them the most and this was an example of one of those things.\u201d Meanwhile, Frank Azor, the co-founder of the Columbus Esports program and a former student at the school, added: \u201cIt\u2019s very personal for me because when I came to this school 25 years ago it was all about traditional sports. Now I\u2019m hoping kids have somewhere to go now where they can take their passion. This is going to change the lives of a lot of kids and hopefully, it\u2019s more than just fun and games.\u201d Matthew Moreno, a sophomore at the center of learning, reflected on the social role of this new program and told WSVN: \u201cI think that it levels the playing field. People will see the jocks and the nerds, you will see a lot of gamers in schools feel very excluded in micro-social spaces and now that it\u2019s becoming more inclusive, it also grants them a ton of opportunities.\u201d In recent times, esports have\u00a0been in everyone\u2019s mouths and minds: the esports industry, projected to reach $5.75 billion in sales by 2030, also draws in multi-million-people audiences.

However, if you're not quite sure what esports are and what they represent, you're reading the right article. Find out everything you need to know below. Esports, short for electronic sports, are a form of competition using video games. Esports often take the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. See also:\u00a0Do You Want to Become an Esports Pro? These 5 Tips Can Help While organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, their popularity increased hugely from 2010 onwards, thanks to live streaming. Which are the most common video game genres related to esports? Multiplayer online battle arena, first-person shooter, fighting, card, battle royales, and real-time strategy games. According to Newzoo, a gaming industry statistics company, the global audience for esports is estimated to reach 641 million by 2025.

A recent report from GlobalData arrived at the conclusion that the esports scene needs an international governing body, like those found in traditional sports. This is because, according to Verdict, one of the main challenges of the industry is accomplishing uniformity, as most esports events are governed individually by game publishers. Thus, there are no clear rules for every game, resulting in ambiguity for the esports teams and players.

        "content": "Tuesday marks the last chance for investors to receive the next  dividend payout from Coca-Cola Consolidated COKE.  The company announced on Thursday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. On Wednesday, Coca-Cola Consolidated will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open 25 cents lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date\u2014in this case, Wednesday. Shareholders who own COKE as of the end of Tuesday's session are eligible to receive the 25 cents dividend payout for every share that they own.  According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on November 10, 2022. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.

Coca-Cola Consolidated also posted a total of $1.40 billion in sales, a 0.14% increase since Q4. Coca-Cola Consolidated earned $19.11 million, and sales totaled $1.40 billion in Q4. Earnings data without context is not clear and can difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to invested capital by a business. Generally, a higher ROIC suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q1, Coca-Cola Consolidated posted an ROIC of 8.58%. It is important to keep in mind that ROIC evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future.  Return on Invested Capital is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital invested by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROIC. A higher ROIC is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROIC suggests the opposite. In Q1, Coca-Cola Consolidated posted an ROIC of 8.58%. Keep in mind, while ROIC is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.  For Coca-Cola Consolidated, the positive return on invested capital ratio of 8.58% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively.  Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Coca-Cola Consolidated reported Q1 earnings per share at $8.42/share, which beat analyst predictions of $7.13/share.

The company announced on Thursday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. On Wednesday, Coca-Cola Consolidated will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open $0.25 lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date\u2014in this case, Wednesday. Shareholders who own COKE as of the end of Tuesday's session are eligible to receive the $0.25 dividend payout for every share that they own.  According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on May 12, 2022. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.  Click here to find details on Coca-Cola Consolidated's previous dividends.

        "content": "Pulled from Benzinga Pro data, Coca-Cola Consolidated COKE posted Q4 earnings of $19.11 million, an increase from Q3 of 72.28%. Sales dropped to $1.40 billion, a 3.77% decrease between quarters. Coca-Cola Consolidated earned $68.93 million, and sales totaled $1.46 billion in Q3. Earnings data without context is not clear and can difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to invested capital by a business. Generally, a higher ROIC suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Coca-Cola Consolidated posted an ROIC of 9.3%. It is important to keep in mind that ROIC evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future.  Return on Invested Capital is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital invested by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROIC. A higher ROIC is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROIC suggests the opposite. In Q4, Coca-Cola Consolidated posted an ROIC of 9.3%. Keep in mind, while ROIC is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.  For Coca-Cola Consolidated, the positive return on invested capital ratio of 9.3% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively.  Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Coca-Cola Consolidated reported Q4 earnings per share at $6.76/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $7.62/share.

        "content": "Coca-Cola Consolidated Inc.\u00a0COKE is facing a lawsuit from an environmental advocacy organization that claims that the \"100% Recyclable\" label on Dasani bottles has violated California's Environmental Marketing Claims Act and the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act.\u00a0\u00a0 What Happened:\u00a0The Dasani brand is owned by the Coca-Cola company under its Beverages (Non-Alcoholic Activity sector). Coca-Cola produces more than 3400 bottles each second under the Dasani brand with the label \"100% Recyclable.\" However, in June, the Sierra Club, a nonprofit organization dedicated to environmental protection has alleged this label is fraudulent.\u00a0 In reality, Dasani bottles are\u00a0not\u00a0100% recyclable as the bottle labels and caps contain polypropylene plastics. The Sierra Club has also found that 28% of each bottle cannot be recycled because processing losses contaminate the bottles. The Sierra Club has also based its lawsuit on the fact that most bottles never end up being recycled.\u00a0 Coca-Cola has also created marketing campaigns with the\u00a0slogan\u00a0\"Every Bottle Back,\" which the Sierra Club claims is proof that they attempted to profit off of false claims.\u00a0 What's Next:\u00a0Coca-Cola asserts that the Sierra Clubs claims have no merit and have moved to throw out the lawsuits. Coke asserts that because consumers or the Sierra Club were never really harmed by the labels, and consumers\u00a0did\u00a0receive \"exactly what they hoped for: Dasani water bottles that were ultimately repurposed for reuse in another product.\" Coke believes that the Sierra Club's legal actions have less to do with consumer protection and more to do with an effort to \"reduce what it considers the harms of single-use plastic.\" In response to the claims, Coke attorneys\u00a0argued\u00a0that \"The word 'recyclable' means only that a product can be recycled,\" and \"No reasonable consumer would interpret it as a guarantee that the product will be recycled and reused. Courts routinely dismiss claims premised on unreasonable interpretations of product labels, and this court should do so here.\" Why It's Important:\u00a0If this lawsuit goes in the Sierra Clubs' favor, Coke could potentially be found to have violated California's Environmental Marketing Claims Act and the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act due to participation in unfair business practices, false marketing, and fraud. Coke could also be required to stop producing \"100% Recyclable\" labels on their bottles and halt any marketing campaigns that make similar claims. Additionally, the defendants in the case are seeking compensatory, statutory, punitive, treble, damage, restitution, and attorney fees, all with interest. The particular amounts will be determined at trial. Still, because the consumer class is so large (anyone who has purchased Dasani bottles), fines could add up to hundreds of millions of dollars.\u00a0 The lawsuit also makes similar claims against Niagara Bottling LLC and BlueTriton Brands Inc.",

What Happened: The New York Post reported the all-Republican commission of Surry County voted 3-2 last week to remove the vending machines, citing Coca-Cola\u2019s opposition of Georgia\u2019s new voting laws. \u201cMillions of Americans believe that the last presidential election was not held in a fair manner and that more voter fraud will occur in the future if elections are not closely monitored and regulated,\u201d wrote Eddie Harris, a county commissioner, to Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey. See Also: If You Invested $1,000 In Coca-Cola Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Harris also voiced his frustration with the domestic political environment in an interview with WXII-TV. \u201cThe left wing in America, they defund, they boycott, they cancel, they tear down statues \u2013 all sorts of egregious actions,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe expectation from them is the opposing political side will cower in the corner and we\u2019re supposed to accept that and it\u2019s supposed to be okay \u2013 and it\u2019s not okay.\u201d What's Next: Despite last week\u2019s vote, the Coca-Cola vending machines are still in place within the county\u2019s office buildings. However, the vending machines are not the property of Coca-Cola\u2019s corporate offices, but belong to Coca-Cola Consolidated COKE, a regional bottling company that operates separately from the Atlanta-headquartered company. Representatives from Coca-Cola Consolidated have sought a meeting with the county commissioners to discuss the issue. (Photo by Mike Mozart / Flickr Creative Commons.)",

HAS, road trips without General Motors Company GM's Chevrolet, binge watching without Comcast Corporation CMCSA, homework without Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL, shopping sprees without Nordstrom, Inc. JWN and birthday calls without AT&T Inc. T Some of the most well-known brands in American culture were established by immigrants or their children. So were more than 200 companies on the 2010 Fortune 500 list \u2014 a number vastly disproportionate to the ratio of U.S. immigrants to native-born Americans. And the statistics go on and on. In 2011, the Partnership for a New American Economy reported that immigrants had founded 20 percent of the Fortune 500 companies established in the previous 25 years. These businesses generated $1.7 trillion in revenue, while those founded by the children of immigrants contributed an additional $2.5 trillion. The total surpassed the GDPs of every country outside the United States, China and Japan. By 2012, the same firm reported that immigrants \u2014 who founded 28 percent of companies in 2011 \u2014 were twice as likely as native-born Americans to launch new businesses. And as of March 2016, immigrants were occupying top management positions at more than 70 percent of billion-dollar startups in the United States \u2014 and they had founded 50.6 percent of them. The National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) reported that the 44 companies, with a collective value of $168 billion, generated an average of 760 American jobs each. Other immigrant-led companies had greater economic impact. At the time of the report, SpaceX employed 4,000, Mu Sigma 3,500 and Palantir Technologies 2,000. In some cases, these economic benefits were stalled by entrepreneurs\u2019 long immigration processes. The founder of the $3.7-billion AppDynamics Inc APPD, Jyoti Bansal, delayed his startup\u2019s founding for seven years as he waited for his employment-based green card. The company now employs 900 workers. Despite his trials, the Indian-born Bansal has achieved his \u2014 and many of his employees\u2019 \u2014 American dream. And he\u2019s in good company. Here is a list of just some of the foreign-born talent at the top of American business:",

The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you\u2019ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. \r\n\tOn the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you\u2019re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company. \r\n\tHere is the list of stocks going ex-dividend on July 27, 2016.",

        "content": "Give the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) XLP some credit. The largest consumer staples exchange-traded fund by assets is up 6.6 percent year-to-date despite strong dollar headwinds and the subsequent challenges created by speculation, though now dwindling, that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates. \tAdd to that, XLP has mustered its >6.6 percent gain, one of the better year-to-date showings among the nine sector SPDR ETFs, with no help from Procter & Gamble Co. PG or Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. WMT.  Procter & Gamble, the world's largest maker of household products, and Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, are two of just seven members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average down at least 10 percent this year. Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart are XLP's largest and sixth-largest holdings, respectively, combining for 16.5 percent of the ETF's weight. Related Link: Top 4 NYSE Stocks In The Beverages-Soft Drinks Industry Even with the struggles of Procter & Gamble, Wal-Mart and some other marquee staples stocks, XLP managed to hit an all-time high last week. In fact, it's the so-called \"sin stocks\" or \"problem children\" stocks \u2013 such as soft drink and tobacco makers \u2013 are leading staples ETFs higher. The Dow Jones U.S. Tobacco Index recently hit an all-time high and the Dow Jones U.S. Soft Drink Index is close to doing the same. \u201cAlso in the beverage arena, soft drink companies have been strong. As a group, they too currently look to be in position to make a run at all-time highs once they break out of what looks like a bull flag on the chart,\u201d said Dana Lyons of J. Lyons Fund Management in a recent blog post. That is good news for XLP. The ETF allocates nearly 37 percent of its combined weight to beverage and tobacco stocks. Dow component  The Coca-Cola Co KO, Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Altria Group Inc MO and PepsiCo, Inc. PEP are all top 10 holdings in the ETF. The PowerShares Dynamic Food & Beverage(ETF) PBJ is another option to consider. As a dedicated food and beverage ETF, PBJ features no tobacco stocks.  However, PBJ's combined weight to PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated COKE and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. DPS is 11.6 percent.  PBJ is up nearly 12 percent. The PowerShares Dynamic Consumer Sta. (ETF) PSL is another staples ETF to consider for investors looking for beverage and tobacco exposure.  PSL, a momentum-based ETF, allocates nearly 27 percent of its combined weight to beverage and tobacco names. PSL is home to 42 stocks and six of its top 10 holdings are either tobacco, spirits or soft drink makers. Knowing that, perhaps it is not surprising that PSL is this year's top-performing staples ETF. Investors have added $231.6 million to PSL this year, a total exceeded by just six other PowerShares ETFs.",
